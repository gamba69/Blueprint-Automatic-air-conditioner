# Automatic-air-conditioner

This blueprint is for using the air conditioner automatically in both winter and summer, based on a start and end temperature. In modo facoltativo, si può abilitare:

- Window status check 
- Water level control in the tank 
- Home presence control 
- Notifications
- Decide on the time slot for operation

Below the settings for operation are:

1) **Entities climate**: Choose the climate entity to be used.
2) **Set temperature sensor**: Select the external temperature sensor to be used for the climate  
3) **Set temperature climate**: Select the temperature to be set at the climate 
4) **Hvac modes**: Select hvac usage mode (heat, cool, dry, fan\_only)
5) **Fan modes**: Select the fan usage mode (auto, high, mid, low). In case your climate settings are different from mine, these can be customized from the source file.
6) **Presence Home**: OPTIONAL Select from the list the group created with person entities for: 
- Turn on the air conditioner if the conditions set for startup are met
- Turn off the air conditioner at the time when you switch to the not\_home state
```
group:
  famiglia:
    entities:
      - person.one
      - person.two
```
8) **Water level**. OPTIONAL: Select the binary\_sensor used to indicate full water tank. To function, it must be set with *device\_class: moisture*.
9) **Window**: OPTIONAL select the binary sensor used for the window contact. To function, it must be set with *device\_class: window*
10) **Target temperature start**: Set the startup temperature:
- If set to winter, the climate will be turned on if the indoor temperature is lower than the set temperature
- If set to summer, the climate will be turned on if the indoor temperature is higher than the set temperature
11) **Target temperature stop**: Set the shutdown temperature:
- If set to winter, the climate will be turned off if the indoor temperature is higher than the set temperature
- If set to summer, the climate will be turned off if the indoor temperature is lower than the set temperature
12) **Delay temperature stop**: Set a delay expressed in minutes for turning off the air conditioner once it reaches “*Target temperature stop*”
13) **Start time**: Set the start time for automatic operation of the climate. NB: If you want the climate to be automatic h24, set Start time and Stop time with the time 00:00:00.
14) **Stop time**: Set the time for automatic climate operation end time and shutdown time. NB: If you want the climate to be automatic h24, set Start time and Stop time with the time 00:00:00.
15) **Device to notify push**: OPTIONAL select the device on which you want to receive the push notification. The device must have the official HomeAssistant app installed.
